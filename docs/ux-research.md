# UX Research: Shape Customization Interfaces in Modern Diagramming Tools

## Executive Summary

This research analyzes the UX patterns and interface designs of four leading diagramming tools (Lucidchart, Figma, Draw.io/diagrams.net, and Miro) to identify best practices for shape customization interfaces. The findings reveal consistent patterns around property panel organization, color picker design, and accessibility considerations that can inform the development of effective shape customization interfaces.

## Research Methodology

- **Tools Analyzed**: Lucidchart, Figma, Draw.io/diagrams.net, Miro
- **Focus Areas**: Property panel layouts, color picker UX, sizing controls, styling organization, keyboard shortcuts, accessibility features
- **Research Date**: September 2025
- **Research Scope**: Public documentation, help articles, and official design resources

## Key Findings Summary

### 1. Property Panel Layout Patterns

All analyzed tools follow a **right sidebar pattern** for property panels, with contextual controls that appear based on selected objects.

### 2. Color Picker Design Patterns

Modern tools integrate **accessibility checks directly into color selection workflows**, with WCAG contrast validation as a standard feature.

### 3. Direct Manipulation vs Panel Controls
