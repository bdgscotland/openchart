# Event Storm Workshop Guide

## Quick Start

Event Storm mode in OpenChart enables facilitators to run high-speed Event Storming workshops with keyboard-driven workflows and smart visual aids.

### Switching to Event Storm Mode

1. Open or create a diagram
2. Click the mode selector in the toolbar
3. Select "Event Storm"
4. Canvas switches to timeline layout with swim lanes

## Workshop Workflow

### 1. Creating Stickies

**Single-Key Shortcuts** - Press a letter key to instantly create a sticky:

**Big Picture Phase:**
- `E` - Domain Event (Orange)
- `A` - Actor (Yellow)
- `Q` - Question/Concern (Purple)

**Process Modeling Phase:**
- `C` - Command (Blue)
- `P` - Policy (Lavender)
- `R` - Read Model (Green)

**Software Design Phase:**
- `G` - Aggregate (Yellow box)
- `X` - External System (Pink)
- `U` - UI/Mockup (White)
- `H` - Hotspot (Red)

**What Happens:**
1. Sticky appears at center of viewport
2. Editing mode opens automatically
3. Type your text immediately
4. Press `Enter` to finish

### 2. Creating Sequences (Shift+Enter)

**For rapid event sequences:**

1. Press `E` to create first event
2. Type "Order Placed"
3. Press `Shift+Enter` (not just Enter!)
4. New event appears below, editing active
5. Type "Payment Processed"
6. Press `Shift+Enter` again
7. Continue building your sequence...

**Final sticky:** Press `Enter` (without Shift) to finish

### 3. Connecting Stickies (Press 'L')

**Quick Connection Mode** - Two clicks to connect:

1. Press `L` key
2. Blue banner appears: "Click source sticky to start connection"
3. Click the source sticky (e.g., "Place Order" command)
4. Banner updates: "Click target sticky to connect"
5. Click the target sticky (e.g., "Order Placed" event)
6. Orange animated edge connects them
7. Mode exits automatically

**To cancel:** Press `Escape`

### 4. Timeline Organization

**Automatic Swim Lane Snapping:**
- Stickies snap to horizontal rows (180px apart)
- Drag stickies vertically - they align to lanes automatically
- Horizontal positioning uses fine 20px grid
- Subtle dashed lines show lane boundaries

**Chronological Flow:**
- Arrange stickies **left to right** in time order
- Earlier events on the left
- Later events on the right
- Use swim lanes for parallel processes or different actors

## Complete Workshop Example

**Scenario:** Modeling an e-commerce order process

### Step 1: Map the Happy Path Events

```
Facilitator: "Let's map what happens when an order succeeds..."

Press 'E' â†’ Type "Order Placed" â†’ Enter
Press 'E' â†’ Type "Payment Processed" â†’ Shift+Enter
Type "Items Picked" â†’ Shift+Enter
Type "Package Shipped" â†’ Shift+Enter
Type "Order Delivered" â†’ Enter
```

**Result:** 5 orange event stickies in a vertical sequence

### Step 2: Identify the Actor

```
Facilitator: "Who starts this process?"

Press 'A' â†’ Type "Customer" â†’ Enter
```

**Result:** Yellow actor sticky appears

### Step 3: Add the Command

```
Facilitator: "What action does the customer take?"

Press 'C' â†’ Type "Place Order" â†’ Enter
```

**Result:** Blue command sticky appears

### Step 4: Connect the Flow

```
Facilitator: "Let's connect these..."

Press 'L' â†’ Click "Customer" â†’ Click "Place Order"
Press 'L' â†’ Click "Place Order" â†’ Click "Order Placed"
```

**Result:** Two orange animated connections

### Step 5: Add Questions

```
Facilitator: "Any unclear points?"

Press 'Q' â†’ Type "What if payment fails?" â†’ Enter
Press 'Q' â†’ Type "Inventory out of stock?" â†’ Enter
```

**Result:** Purple question stickies for discussion

**Total Time:** ~2 minutes for complete flow!

## Workshop Facilitation Tips

### Starting a Workshop

1. **Set the Context**
   - Create actor stickies first (`A` key)
   - Place them in the leftmost lane
   - One actor per swim lane

2. **Explore Events**
   - Use `E` key + Shift+Enter for rapid sequences
   - Left to right = chronological order
   - Top to bottom = parallel processes

3. **Add Commands Later**
   - After events are mapped, add commands (`C` key)
   - Place commands to the left of resulting events
   - Connect with `L` key

### Phase Progression

**Phase 1: Big Picture (Start Here)**
- Focus: Events + Actors only
- Goal: Understand the domain story
- Time: 30-60 minutes
- Keys: `E`, `A`, `Q`

**Phase 2: Process Modeling**
- Focus: Add Commands, Policies, Read Models
- Goal: Understand decision points and automation
- Time: 60-90 minutes
- Keys: `C`, `P`, `R`

**Phase 3: Software Design**
- Focus: Add Aggregates, Boundaries
- Goal: Define system structure
- Time: 60-90 minutes
- Keys: `G`, `X`, `U`

### Remote Workshops

**Recommended Setup:**
1. Facilitator shares screen with OpenChart
2. Participants call out sticky content
3. Facilitator uses keyboard shortcuts to build model live
4. Git commits capture iterations
5. Share diagram file via repository

**Async Collaboration:**
1. Initial facilitator creates base model
2. Commits to git repository
3. Team members clone and iterate
4. Pull requests for model changes
5. Commit messages explain domain decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Shortcuts Not Working

**Problem:** Pressing letter keys doesn't create stickies

**Solutions:**
1. Check you're in Event Storm mode (mode selector shows "Event Storm")
2. Make sure you're not typing in a text input
3. Close any editing stickies first (press Enter or Escape)
4. Check sticky type is available in current phase

### Can't Connect Stickies

**Problem:** Connection mode doesn't work

**Solutions:**
1. Press `L` key first (blue banner should appear)
2. Click on the sticky itself, not empty space
3. Can't connect sticky to itself (try different target)
4. Press Escape and try again if stuck

### Stickies Won't Snap to Lanes

**Problem:** Manual dragging doesn't align to lanes

**Solutions:**
1. Verify snap-to-grid is enabled in settings
2. Release mouse button to trigger snap
3. Stickies snap on drag end, not during drag
4. Try small movements to see snap behavior

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Events (Orange):**
- Past tense: "Order Placed", "Payment Processed"
- Domain language: Use business terms, not technical jargon
- Specific: "Customer Registered" not just "Registration"

**Commands (Blue):**
- Imperative: "Place Order", "Process Payment"
- User intent: What the actor wants to accomplish
- Active voice: "Submit Form" not "Form Submitted"

**Actors (Yellow):**
- Nouns: "Customer", "Administrator", "Payment System"
- Specific roles: "Warehouse Manager" not just "User"
- Systems as actors: "Email Service", "Inventory System"

### Layout Strategy

**Horizontal (Time):**
- Left to right = chronological
- Align related events vertically
- Group bounded contexts with white space

**Vertical (Swim Lanes):**
- One actor per lane (optional)
- Parallel processes in separate lanes
- Related aggregates stay together

### Color Usage

**Core Flow:** Orange events + Blue commands
**Supporting:** Yellow actors + Green read models
**Boundaries:** Yellow aggregate boxes
**Issues:** Purple questions + Red hotspots

### Workshop Pacing

**Fast:** Keyboard shortcuts for rapid exploration
**Slow:** Mouse/drag for careful positioning
**Mixed:** Keyboard for content, mouse for refinement

## Advanced Techniques

### Aggregate Discovery

1. Create events first (all orange stickies)
2. Look for clusters of related events
3. Press `G` to create aggregate box
4. Drag and resize to encompass cluster
5. Name aggregate based on consistency boundary

### Policy Identification

1. Look for "When X happens, then Y happens" patterns
2. Press `P` to create policy sticky
3. Place between trigger event and resulting command
4. Label: "When [event], then [command]"
5. Connect: event â†’ policy â†’ command

### Hotspot Marking

1. During discussion, mark contentious areas
2. Press `H` for hotspot sticky
3. Describe the problem or uncertainty
4. Revisit in later phases
5. Convert to questions or decisions later
