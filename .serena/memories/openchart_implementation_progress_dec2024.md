# OpenChart Implementation Progress - December 2024

## 🎯 Current Session Achievements

### ✅ Completed Today
1. **Fixed Edge Connection Visual Feedback** (Commit: 5aa1644)
   - Connection handles now visible in orange when connector tool selected
   - Handles grow to 14px in connection mode for easier targeting
   - All shapes update dynamically when switching tools
   - Visual hierarchy: orange=ready, green=active, blue=normal

### 📍 Current State Analysis

#### Working Features
- ✅ Shape rendering (61+ shapes)
- ✅ Resize with directional handles (BaseShape.tsx:84-169)
- ✅ Property panel styling controls
- ✅ Canvas drag, zoom, pan
- ✅ Export (PNG, SVG, PDF, WebP)
- ✅ JSON save/load
- ✅ Connection mode visual feedback

#### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Connection reliability** - Edge creation inconsistent
2. **Undo/Redo disconnected** - CommandManager exists but not wired
3. **Performance** - Degrades with 20+ shapes
4. **Grid visibility** - Hard to see/missing

## 🚀 Next Implementation Tasks

### Quick Wins (Ready to implement)
1. **Wire Up Undo/Redo** 
   - CommandManager at `src/core/commands/CommandManager.ts`
   - Just needs connection to App.tsx handleUndo/handleRedo
   - Commands already built: BulkStyleCommand, MoveElementCommand, etc.

2. **Optimize Shape Rendering**
   - BaseShape memo comparison needs improvement (line 461)
   - Add React.memo to child shapes
   - Batch style updates with debounce

### Core Fixes Needed
1. **Connection System** (src/components/Canvas/FlowCanvas.tsx:203-217)
   - Connection pooling not working
   - Need connection preview during drag
   - Edge validation incomplete

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - No virtualization for 61-shape library
   - PropertyPanel excessive re-renders
   - Missing debounce on style updates

## 📂 Key Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx` - Added selectedTool propagation to nodes (lines 187-199)
- `src/components/Canvas/shapes/BaseShape.tsx` - Enhanced connection handles (lines 58, 280-285, etc.)

## 🔧 Technical Debt
- Mixed state management (React Flow + React state)
- Many `any` types need fixing
- No error boundaries
- Grid snapping incomplete

## 💡 Implementation Priority
Week 1: Undo/Redo → Shape optimization → Connection fixes
Week 2: Command integration → Multi-select → Keyboard shortcuts
Week 3: Performance → Error handling → Advanced features

## 🎨 Recent Improvements
- Resize functionality fully working with directional handles
- Connection mode now has clear visual indicators
- Shape library expanded to 61+ shapes
- Comprehensive property panel controls

## ⚠️ Development Notes
- Always use `./start.sh` to run dev server
- Never use `npm run dev` directly
- Project is early prototype, not production-ready
- Focus on fixing existing features before adding new ones

## 🔄 Last Working State
- Commit: 5aa1644 (feat: Enhanced connection mode visual feedback)
- Branch: main
- All changes committed and stable
- Ready to continue with undo/redo implementation
