# OpenChart Implementation Progress - December 2024

## üéØ Current Session Achievements

### ‚úÖ Major Features Completed Today (Commit: e8b0770)

**Multi-Select System**
- ‚úÖ Ctrl+A select all functionality working perfectly
- ‚úÖ Individual click selection with visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Selection toolbar with count display ("13 selected")
- ‚úÖ Checkmark (‚úì) indicators on selected items
- ‚úÖ Multi-element properties panel ("Style 12" tab)

**Copy/Paste Operations**
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+D
- ‚úÖ Smart offset positioning prevents overlapping
- ‚úÖ Connection preservation between copied elements
- ‚úÖ Full integration with multi-select system

**Bulk Operations**
- ‚úÖ Selection toolbar with duplicate/delete buttons
- ‚úÖ Alignment tools (left, center, right)
- ‚úÖ Bulk style editing for multiple elements
- ‚úÖ Professional visual feedback throughout

**Project Organization**
- ‚úÖ 8 comprehensive GitHub issues created with templates
- ‚úÖ 3 strategic milestones (P1: Canvas, P2: File Ops, P3: Git)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced labeling system for better categorization
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent development framework established

### üìç Current State Analysis

#### ‚úÖ Working Features
- Basic diagramming (shapes, connections, resize)
- Multi-select with keyboard shortcuts
- Copy/paste with smart positioning
- Selection toolbar and bulk operations
- Visual feedback (checkmarks, selection counts)
- Property panel integration for multi-element editing
- Canvas interaction (drag, zoom, pan)
- Export functionality (PNG, SVG, PDF, WebP)
- JSON save/load persistence

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- **Drag selection box** - Ctrl+A works but mouse drag selection needs refinement
- **Custom edge types** - Temporarily disabled due to positioning issues
- **Undo/Redo** - System exists but not fully integrated
- **Performance** - Needs optimization with many shapes
- **Advanced features** - Many commercial features still missing

## üé® Recent Technical Improvements

**React Flow Configuration** (FlowCanvas.tsx:753-758)
```typescript
selectNodesOnDrag={false}
selectionOnDrag={true}
multiSelectionKeyCode="Ctrl"
panOnDrag={[1, 2]}  // Only middle/right mouse for panning
selectionMode="partial"  // Partial selection allowed
```

**Multi-Select Integration** (App.tsx:100-103)
- Smart selection state management
- Proper React Flow synchronization
- Clipboard operations with connection preservation

## üöÄ Next Priority Tasks

### High Priority (Ready to implement)
1. **Fix Drag Selection Box** - Mouse drag selection needs debugging
2. **Re-enable Custom Edge Types** - Fix positioning issues in edge components
3. **Undo/Redo Integration** - Wire existing CommandManager to UI
4. **Performance Optimization** - React.memo and virtualization

### Medium Priority
1. **Advanced Connection Tools** - Re-enable curved/dashed edges safely
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Expand beyond current copy/paste
3. **Grid Improvements** - Better visibility and snapping
4. **Error Handling** - Add error boundaries and validation

## üìÇ Key Files Updated

**Core Components**
- `src/App.tsx` - Multi-select and clipboard integration
- `src/components/Canvas/FlowCanvas.tsx` - Selection configuration
- `src/components/Canvas/SelectionToolbar.tsx` - Bulk operations UI
- `src/hooks/useClipboard.ts` - Smart copy/paste logic

**New Connection Framework** (temporarily disabled)
- `src/components/Canvas/edges/` - Custom edge components
- `src/components/Toolbar/ConnectionTools.tsx` - Connection UI
- `src/types/edgeTypes.ts` - Edge type definitions

## üîß Technical Debt & Cleanup Needed

**Code Quality**
- Remove overly optimistic comments about "professional-grade"
- Clean up `any` types in edge components
- Add proper error handling for edge cases
- Improve TypeScript strictness

**Documentation**
- Update CLAUDE.md with realistic expectations ‚úÖ
- Clean up implementation documentation
- Remove marketing language from code comments

## üí° Development Philosophy

**Be Realistic**
- This is an experimental prototype, not production software
- Focus on core functionality over advanced features
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Avoid overpromising capabilities

**Technical Focus**
- Multi-select and copy/paste are solid foundations
- Connection system needs refinement before adding complexity
- Performance optimization should come before new features
- User experience should be consistent and predictable

## üîÑ Current Working State

- **Commit**: e8b0770 (feat: Add multi-select and copy/paste functionality)
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Multi-select and copy/paste working well, ready for next phase
- **Focus**: Fix drag selection and re-enable custom edges carefully

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Reminders

- Always use `./start.sh` for development server
- Test multi-select features regularly (Ctrl+A is reliable baseline)
- Keep custom edge types disabled until positioning is fixed
- Maintain realistic expectations about current capabilities
- Focus on improving existing features before adding new ones
