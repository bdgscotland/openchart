# OpenChart Project Overview - REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

## Purpose
OpenChart is an **experimental prototype** for an open-source diagramming tool. This is **NOT a production-ready application** and should be treated as a learning/development project.

## Current Reality (December 2024)
**‚ö†Ô∏è EARLY PROTOTYPE - MANY FEATURES BROKEN ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### üêõ Major Known Issues
- **Shape rendering problems**: Many shapes display incorrectly or appear black
- **Resize functionality broken**: Shape handles don't work properly  
- **Connection problems**: Edge creation and editing is unreliable
- **Grid visibility issues**: Grid may be hard to see or not display
- **Export failures**: Export functions may not work consistently
- **No reliable persistence**: Diagrams may not save properly
- **Performance issues**: App can become slow with multiple shapes
- **Incomplete undo/redo**: History management is partial at best

### ‚úÖ What Sort Of Works
- Basic shape placement from sidebar (when it works)
- Simple drag and drop (unreliable)
- Basic zoom and pan controls
- Some property panel functionality (buggy)
- PNG export (sometimes works)

### üî¨ Recently Added (Experimental)
- Action toolbar with undo/redo buttons (functionality limited)
- 61 shapes in library (many don't render correctly)
- Collapsible sidebars (may be buggy)
- Multiple export formats (reliability varies)
- Enhanced property panel (incomplete)

## Technology Stack
- **React + TypeScript**: For component architecture
- **React Flow**: For node-based diagram engine (migration incomplete)
- **Vite**: For development and build tooling
- **Lucide React**: For icons
- **html-to-image**: For export (when working)

## Development Status: PROTOTYPE ONLY
- **Not suitable for real work**: Will lose your data
- **Frequent bugs**: Many features don't work as expected
- **Breaking changes**: Updates may break existing functionality
- **No support**: This is experimental code
- **For developers only**: Learning React Flow, contributing to OSS

## Honest Next Steps
1. **Fix basic shape rendering** - Priority #1
2. **Make resize handles work** - Priority #2  
3. **Fix connection/edge tools** - Priority #3
4. **Add reliable save/load** - Priority #4
5. **Performance optimization** - Priority #5

## Reality Check
This project is much further from being a "Lucidchart alternative" than the code comments might suggest. It's a prototype with many fundamental issues that need fixing before it can be considered even a basic working tool.
