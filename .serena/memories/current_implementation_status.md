# OpenChart Current Implementation Status - REALITY CHECK

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROJECT STATUS: EARLY PROTOTYPE WITH SIGNIFICANT ISSUES

### üö´ MAJOR BROKEN FEATURES:

#### Shape System:
- **Shape rendering**: Many shapes display as black boxes or incorrectly
- **Resize handles**: Visual only - don't actually resize shapes
- **Shape positioning**: May not work reliably
- **Shape selection**: Inconsistent behavior

#### Canvas System:
- **Grid display**: May not show properly or hard to see
- **Connection tools**: Edge creation is unreliable
- **Performance**: Degrades with multiple shapes
- **Interactions**: Click handlers may fail randomly

#### Data Persistence:
- **Save functionality**: May not capture current state properly
- **Load functionality**: Unreliable restoration of diagrams
- **Export**: PNG/SVG export fails frequently
- **Data loss risk**: High - don't use for important work

### üòê PARTIALLY WORKING FEATURES:

#### Basic UI:
- **Shape library**: Displays 61 shapes (many broken)
- **Property panel**: Shows controls (functionality limited)
- **Toolbar**: Basic layout exists
- **Action toolbar**: Recently added but functions are incomplete

#### Limited Functionality:
- **Basic shape placement**: Sometimes works from sidebar
- **Simple drag**: Works when shapes render correctly
- **Zoom/pan**: Basic viewport controls function
- **Tool selection**: Visual feedback exists

### üîß RECENT ATTEMPTS (December 2024):
- Added action toolbar with undo/redo (mostly non-functional)
- Expanded shape library to 61 shapes (many don't work)
- Enhanced property panel (incomplete integration)
- Multiple export formats (unreliable)
- Collapsible sidebars (may introduce new bugs)

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL STATUS:

### Technology Decisions:
- **React Flow**: Migration from Konva.js incomplete
- **TypeScript**: Types exist but many any types used
- **State Management**: Mixed between React state and Zustand
- **Build System**: Vite works reliably

### Code Quality Issues:
- **Mixed patterns**: Old Konva.js code mixed with React Flow
- **Incomplete features**: Many half-implemented functions
- **Performance problems**: Unoptimized rendering and state updates
- **Testing**: Minimal test coverage

## üéØ HONEST ASSESSMENT:

### What This Project Is:
- A learning exercise in React Flow
- A prototype for testing diagramming concepts
- Early development code with many bugs
- Experimental implementation of UI patterns

### What This Project Is NOT:
- A production-ready diagramming tool
- Reliable for any real work
- Feature-complete or stable
- Ready for end users

### For Contributors:
- Expect to encounter many bugs
- Many "implemented" features don't actually work
- Focus on fixing basic functionality first
- Don't expect commercial-grade architecture

## üî® CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:
1. **Shape rendering system** - Make shapes display correctly
2. **Resize functionality** - Implement working resize handles
3. **Connection system** - Fix edge creation and editing
4. **Save/load reliability** - Prevent data loss
5. **Performance optimization** - Handle multiple shapes properly

## üö® USER WARNING:
This application will likely frustrate users expecting basic diagramming functionality. It's suitable only for developers interested in contributing to the codebase or learning React Flow concepts.
