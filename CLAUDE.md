# OpenChart Development Configuration

## 🎯 Project Overview
OpenChart is an open-source, git-backed diagramming platform built with React + TypeScript + React Flow. This is a Lucidchart alternative focused on transparency, portability, and version control.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Development Guidelines
- **NEVER claim this is production-ready** - It's an early prototype
- **Be honest about limitations** - Many features are incomplete or missing
- **Keep it real** - This is a work in progress, not a Lucidchart killer
- **Focus on what works** - Basic diagramming, save/load, simple shapes
- **Acknowledge what doesn't** - No real resize, limited edge types, no undo/redo yet

## 🛠️ Required Development Tools

### Core Tool Requirements
- **Serena MCP**: ALWAYS use for semantic code retrieval and editing operations
- **Context7 MCP**: ALWAYS use for up-to-date third-party library documentation
- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: ALWAYS use for any decision-making processes
- **Playwright MCP**: ALWAYS use for frontend testing and browser automation
- **openchart-data-persistence Agent**: ALWAYS use when:
  - Adding new features that need to be saved/loaded
  - Modifying node or edge properties
  - Debugging save/load issues
  - Changing the canvas state management
  - Testing diagram persistence
  - Updating React Flow integration

### Data Persistence Agent Usage

**MUST use openchart-data-persistence agent for:**
- ANY changes to node/edge structure or properties
- Before merging features that add new visual elements
- When React Flow is updated or reconfigured
- If save/load functionality appears broken
- Adding new shape types or connection types
- Implementing features like layers, groups, or templates

**The agent will:**
- Ensure all new properties are serialized
- Test save/load round-trip integrity
- Update JSON schema documentation
- Verify React Flow state synchronization
- Add migration logic if schema changes

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Canvas Rendering**: React Flow (NOT Konva.js anymore)
- **State Management**: React state + React Flow internal state
- **Version Control**: isomorphic-git
- **File Format**: JSON schema for diagrams
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Jest for unit tests

## 📋 Development Workflow

### Code Analysis & Retrieval
```bash
# Use Serena for all code operations
mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview     # Understand file structure
mcp__serena__find_symbol             # Find specific functions/classes
mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols # Track dependencies
mcp__serena__search_for_pattern      # Search code patterns
```

### Documentation & Research
```bash
# Use Context7 for third-party docs
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id    # Find library documentation
mcp__context7__get-library-docs      # Get up-to-date API docs
```

### Decision Making
```bash
# Use Sequential Thinking for complex decisions
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking  # Break down complex problems
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Use Playwright for all browser testing
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate    # Navigate to app
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot    # Capture UI state
mcp__playwright__browser_click       # Interact with elements
mcp__playwright__browser_type        # Input text/data
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure & Conventions

### Directory Structure
```

### Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components with hooks
- Zustand for state management
- JSON schema validation for diagrams
- Command pattern for undo/redo
- Git-first file operations

## 🚀 Development Commands

### 🔥 ALWAYS Use start.sh
```bash
./start.sh               # REQUIRED - Only way to start development
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: We ALWAYS use `start.sh` for development startup. **NEVER** use `npm run dev` directly.

**🚫 DO NOT USE:**
- `npm run dev`
- `vite`
- Any other direct commands

**✅ ALWAYS USE:**
- `./start.sh` for development
- This is the ONLY approved way to start the dev server

### Why start.sh?
The startup script ensures:
1. ✅ Node.js 18+ version verification
2. 📦 Dependencies are installed/updated automatically
3. 🔍 TypeScript type checking runs first
4. 🧹 ESLint validates code quality
5. 🗑️ Previous build artifacts are cleaned
6. 🚀 Vite dev server starts on http://localhost:5173
7. ⚠️ Graceful handling of warnings (continues with info)

### Manual Commands (For CI/Build Only)
```bash
npm run build           # Production build (CI/deployment)
npm run preview         # Preview production build
npm run lint            # Run ESLint manually
npm run type-check      # Run TypeScript checking manually
```

**Note**: Manual `npm run dev` should NOT be used for regular development. Always use `./start.sh`.

### Testing Commands
```bash
npm run test            # Run unit tests
npm run test:e2e        # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode for tests
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint            # ESLint
npm run type-check      # TypeScript checking
npm run format          # Prettier formatting
```

## 📐 Core Features Implementation

### Canvas Operations (Priority 1)
- Basic shapes: rectangle, circle, diamond, arrow
- Mouse interactions: drag, resize, select
- Multi-select operations
- Undo/redo command pattern

### File Operations (Priority 2)
- Save/load JSON diagrams
- Export to PNG, SVG, PDF
- Import from Lucidchart JSON

### Git Integration (Priority 3)
