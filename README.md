# OpenChart

An open-source diagramming tool built with React Flow. Early prototype.

## What Works

- **Basic Shapes**: Rectangle, Circle, Diamond, Triangle, Hexagon, Star
- **Connections**: Draw edges between nodes
- **Save/Load**: Export and import diagrams as JSON
- **Export**: PNG, SVG, PDF (basic implementation)
- **Dark Mode**: Professional dark theme

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
./start.sh

# Or manually
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- React Flow (diagramming engine)
- Vite (build tool)
- Lucide React (icons)

## Current Limitations

- No undo/redo
- Resize handles are visual only
- Limited edge customization
- No keyboard shortcuts
- No collaborative features
- Not production ready

## Project Status

This is an early prototype exploring what an open-source, git-friendly diagramming tool could look like. It's functional for basic flowcharts but nowhere near feature-complete.
