5. **It's Intuitive**: New users productive in minutes
6. **It's Reliable**: 99.9% uptime, graceful error handling
7. **It's Complete**: All standard diagramming features present
8. **It's Tested**: Automated tests prevent regressions
9. **It's Documented**: Users can find help easily
10. **It's Maintainable**: Clean code, clear architecture

## üîÑ Next Immediate Actions

1. **Run openchart-data-persistence agent** to verify save/load integrity
2. **Audit all UI elements** - make everything functional
3. **Implement core missing features** from Phase 1
4. **Add comprehensive error handling**
5. **Create test suite** for critical paths
6. **Performance profiling** and optimization
7. **User testing** with real diagrams
8. **Documentation** for every feature
